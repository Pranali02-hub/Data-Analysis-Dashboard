# PROJECT ON SALES AND CUSTOMER INSIGHTS

## Project-Objective
   The objective of this project is to analyze sales and customer behavior data using Power BI to uncover key insights such as regional performance, product category trends, customer churn risk, and average order      values—enabling data-driven decision-making without the need for coding.

## Dataset-Used

## Question (KPIs)
   * Which product categories are sold most frequently across each region?
   * How does the average order value differ by region?
   * Which products are distributed across which regions?
   *  What is the churn probability distribution among customers?

## Process
  ### 1. Dataset Selection
- Sourced dataset from Kaggle containing customer ID, region, churn probability, order value, product ID, and category.

### 2. Data Import & Cleaning
- Loaded dataset into Power BI using “Get Data”
- Cleaned data using Power Query: removed duplicates, renamed columns, corrected data types

### 3. Data Modeling
- Used a flat single-table model for simple visual analysis
- Defined basic measures like sum and count for visualization

### 4. Dashboard Creation
Created a multi-chart dashboard with the following visuals:
- **Bar Chart** – Most Frequent Product Category by Region
- **Line Chart** – Average Order Value by Region
- **Pie Chart** – Customer Count by Churn Probability
- **Bar Chart** – Product Distribution by Region

### 5. Styling & Customization
- Applied a color theme, consistent fonts, and formatting
- Added slicers for dynamic filtering by region and product

### 6. Insight Extraction
- Analyzed dashboard visuals to derive actionable insights
